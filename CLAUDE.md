# clawless-site, agent operating notes

This is the marketing website for Clawless Computer (the desktop app),
hosted at clawless.ai. Built with Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind v4,
static-exported, deployed to Cloudflare Pages via a GitHub Actions
wrangler-action workflow.

## Workflow

Trunk-based on `main` (locked 2026-04-30, replaces the older dev → main
flow). Direct commits, local sanity gate before push, no PRs. The
sister repo `rbjglobal-site` uses the same rule.

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run test            # 16 tests, includes the LS webhook handler
bun run build           # Static export to out/
git push origin main
```

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `main`: install,
typecheck, test, build, then `wrangler pages deploy out/`. Deploy
finishes in ~3 minutes. The webhook receiver at `functions/lemonsqueezy.ts`
runs on Cloudflare Pages Functions (Node-compatible runtime, deployed
with the static site as a single project).

**Do NOT run `bun run build` while `bun run dev` is active.** They
share `.next/` and corrupt each other. Stop the dev server first or
use a separate clone.

## Voice and brand rules (locked)

- No em-dashes (—) anywhere in user-facing copy. Hyphens in compound
  words are fine. Comments in code are fine. The rule is for the
  rendered surface.
- No superlatives ("world-class", "leading", "innovative",
  "revolutionary", "best-in-class").
- No competitor naming or anti-positioning by default. Factual
  contrasts of price or feature posture are allowed only on
  `/pricing` and only with explicit Clawless Advisor approval.
- Anthropic.com-style institutional calm. Reading-page voice, not
  startup landing-page energy.
- Two typefaces only: Newsreader serif for headings, Inter sans for
  body. Both self-hosted via `next/font/google`.
- **Zero data collection** on the marketing surface: no analytics,
  no cookies, no email forms, no newsletter, no third-party scripts.
  This is a founder rule that overrides any future "we should collect
  X" proposal. The trial activates inside the desktop app, not via a
  signup form on the site.
- Primary CTA across the site is `/download`, not `/pricing`. The site
  has no signup flow.

## Coordination with Clawless Advisor

For positioning decisions, copy red-lines, cross-product framing
questions, naming sanity-checks, and anything that touches more than
one repo, route to the `Clawless Advisor` ClaudeLink role first. The
Advisor is the founder's planning terminal and the canonical source of
"is this on-brand?" judgment across the family (clawless.ai +
rbjglobal.com + clawdemy.org + whisprdesk.com).

For routine workflow choices (file paths, commit shape, sanity gate
order, link colors, etc.), decide yourself and report after. Escalate
only for critical issues.

## Receiving updates from sister product terminals

Other terminals (clawless-developer, Clawdemy-Educational_Site,
WhisprDesk, the Advisor) will send ClaudeLink messages when they ship
something this marketing site should reflect. You are the editor.

When you receive one:

1. Acknowledge within an hour during work sessions.
2. Verify the change is actually live before claiming it on the
   marketing site (visit the URL, check the commit, confirm the
   feature is reachable in the shipped desktop build).
3. Draft the change in this repo following voice + brand rules above.
4. Sanity gate, commit, push. Cloudflare auto-deploys.
5. Reply to the sender with the commit hash + live URL once deployed.

If a message lacks required content (product name, one-line summary,
suggested copy snippet, link to commit/PR/release, page placement),
reply asking for the missing pieces before drafting. Do not invent
claims.

## Site shape (current)

Indexable pages:
- `/` (home, launch-ready hero with "Coming Q3 2026" pill)
- `/features`
- `/pricing`
- `/download` (placeholder microcopy until launch-day signed releases)
- `/about`

Noindexed legal pages (placeholder copy, deindexed via `robots: { index: false }`
+ `app/robots.ts` disallow + sitemap exclusion):
- `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookies`, `/disclaimer`

Webhook surface (not a page):
- `functions/lemonsqueezy.ts` at `/lemonsqueezy` — Lemon Squeezy
  webhook receiver, Phase 1 logging stub. Hardened with body size
  cap, signature length guard, Retry-After hint. See `WEBHOOKS.md`.

## Pre-launch backlog (gates on external deps)

- **Drop the "Coming Q3 2026" hero pill** AND the `/download`
  placeholder microcopy in the same launch-day commit. Gated on:
  LLC Apple Developer cert + Windows EV cert + first signed release
  upload. Do not split — keep aspirational language consistent until
  everything goes live together.
- **Privacy + Terms LLC entity-of-record paragraphs.** When real
  legal copy lands, also reverse the SEO deindex (drop noindex,
  drop robots disallow, re-add to sitemap at priority 0.3).
- **`/features` Browser Automation group (B66).** Phase 1 ships
  pre-GA with default-off, permission-prompted, headless-only
  posture. Capture conservatively — do not promise viewport
  streaming or per-agent scope (those are Phase 2).
- **`lib/constants.ts` "20+ platforms" → "22 platforms"** once channel
  verification stabilizes pre-launch (P3, low priority).

## LLC entity name

The operating entity is **RBJ Global LLC** (decision finalized
2026-05-02). Texas Certificate of Amendment is filed but not yet
state-approved as of this writing; the bank-account update is also
pending. The name in code/docs/site can update now. Do **not** submit
"RBJ Global LLC" to external reviewers (Lemon Squeezy, Apple, Stripe,
banks, lawyers, CAs) as the official entity name until both gates
clear.
